          <h2>Our Vision - For the Patient</h2>
          <p>
            At the heart of our mission is a simple belief: clinical trial labels should serve patients first. Too often, medication labeling is treated as a regulatory checkbox or a logistical
            necessity for warehouses and sites. But for the person who actually takes the medication — the patient — labels can be confusing, outdated, or hard to access. We think that's unacceptable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today's clinical trial participants are digitally connected. They carry smartphones, expect real-time information, and deserve clarity, confidence, and support in their treatment journey.
            That's why we design eLabels with the patient in mind — clear, intuitive, and accessible from anywhere, anytime.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're bringing world-class technology to a space that needs it most. By modernizing how patients access medication information, we're not only improving clinical trial experiences — we're
            setting a new standard for care, empathy, and trust in the clinical supply chain.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Vision - For the Industry</h2>
          <p>
            eLabelling has been part of the conversation in clinical trials for nearly two decades. It’s discussed at every major conference and cited as a clear step forward for trial efficiency and
            patient engagement. And yet — for most sponsors — it remains out of reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            The barriers have been technical, operational, and regulatory. But more than that, they’ve been structural. The industry has made eLabelling feel like a special project instead of a
            standard capability. Sponsors face unnecessary friction, inconsistent requirements, and fragmented delivery models that make scale nearly impossible.
          </p>
          <p>We're here to change that</p>
          <p>
            Our vision is to make eLabelling as routine, reliable, and expected as RTSM, EDC, or eConsent. We bring together modern technology, deep clinical expertise, and relentless execution to
            remove the complexity and unlock the full potential of digital labeling — not in the future, but now.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clinical research world deserves tools that are fast, scalable, and built for today’s trials. Our mission is to help the industry move forward — with confidence, with clarity, and
            without compromise.

        <div id="about" class="page" style="display: none">
          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>We are a young startup with a bold mission — to make eLabelling standard, scalable, and seamless for every clinical trial.</p>
          <p>
            While our company may be new, our team brings together hundreds of years of combined experience across clinical supply chain, labeling, technology, and clinical operations. We've worked on
            dozens of global studies, and we know firsthand the gaps, delays, and frustrations that have held back the promise of digital labeling for far too long.
          </p>
          <h2>Now is the time to change that</h2>
          <p>
            We've built a modern, industry-grade platform dedicated entirely to eLabelling. This isn't a side project. It's not a bolt-on. It's our core focus — and we're building it to integrate
            effortlessly with the systems, workflows, and expectations of today’s trials.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are independent by design. We are not affiliated with any CRO or CMO. That means we can partner broadly, work flexibly, and move fast — always putting sponsors and patients at the
            center of what we do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded and based in the United States, we collaborate closely with partners across the U.S. and Europe, supporting global studies with scalable, compliant technology that works across
            borders.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are ambitious, collaborative, and laser-focused on the future. While we specialize in eLabelling, we believe in a connected eClinical ecosystem — and we actively partner with other
            vendors, sponsors, and stakeholders who share our vision of a smarter, more patient-friendly clinical trial experience.
          </p>
          <h2>How Can we help you?</h2>
          <p>
            With the rise of cloud computing, AI, cybersecurity threats, and digital transformation, businesses must continuously refine their IT strategies. An adaptive, forward-thinking approach
            ensures long-term success.
